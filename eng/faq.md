# FAQ

## Will there be an ad-free feature?

Currently, ads are the main source of development and maintenance income for `Daily Money One`. Without sufficient user support, it will be difficult to continuously update and maintain. When embedding ads, I try to consider not affecting the user experience. I plan to launch an ad-free version or provide an ad-free option. Until then, I hope users who want an ad-free experience can understand and help promote `Daily Money One`.

## Will there be an iOS version?

I plan to launch an iOS version, which is why I chose to rewrite `Daily Money One` using a cross-platform programming language. However, due to limited time and resources, the iOS version will be released last, when conditions are favorable. This also requires your usage and promotion to let more people know and use `Daily Money One`, so the iOS version can be smoothly launched.

## What if I really forgot my password?

If you have a previous backup or exported JSON file, simply clear `Daily Money One` application data on Android, then restore or import the backup file to recover your data (the password is not stored in the backup file or JSON file). If you really don't have a backup, you can use the `Reset Password Procedure` on the password input screen, Then email me (cola.orange@gmail.com), explain your reason in the email, copy and paste the Reset Password Token to the mail too, and also attach a screenshot of your phone screen as proof. Upon receiving your email, I will arrange time to generate a reset password code and reply to you. After receiving the reset code, you just need to copy the code into the Reset Password Code field on the screen and press the button to reset the password. Please note that the I do not guarantee the timeliness and effectiveness of this procedure, so it is essential to remember your password no matter what.
